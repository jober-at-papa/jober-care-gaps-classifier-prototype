f,health_plan_benefits,Home assistance,"Ms. Barker is still struggling with the side effects from her medications as previously documented in my notes. She is not sleeping, and is now feeling disoriented and blurry from the lack of sleep. This is creating a fall risk for her being an amputee, and she feels that her medical team is not listening to her. She has made multiple phone calls, visited the doctor's in person, and feels she is getting no where. She is experiencing degradation in her mental health, which was a fear of hers being so isolated and disabled. She had made great strides in her mental health over the last four or five months, but now without being to sleep, having her medications completely changed, and having few resources to connect with others, she is finding herself experiencing suicide ideation. I made suggestions as to approaching self advocacy with her medical team, as well as encouraged her to answer calls from family and specify her exact needs. I also encouraged her to call for a copy of her recent psychiatric and psychological health records as she is unsure about what she has been diagnosed with. Ultimately, she feels that due to her age and ethnicity, she isn't taken seriously, and is being pushed through appointments as quickly as possible without being heard, and left to suffer alone when she gets home. She reports not having left her home in over a month except to see a doctor, having no visitors and infrequent calls from family. I reminder her that Papa Pal is here to assist and she does have a preferred in-person pal she can call for companionship as well, but the depression is a major roadblock and is growing. I have listed this virtual visit as healthcare and fall risks both due to the aforementioned. Ms. Barker's daughter was calling at the end of the visit, and I asked Ms. Barker to clearly tell her daughter that she needs more interaction and share a bit about what is going on."
