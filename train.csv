Papa was reminded we take him, pick him and return him to his home, assists with errands and med pickup and to consider Papa for backup. Papa was told about OTC benefits and other benefits supported by his plan. Papa and his wife for fitness go to Planet Fitness 1x a week but hadn't been in about two weeks due to multiple doctor's appointments to check his heart and vein blockage. Papa said recently a case worker has been assigned to him and will be coming by the home on a regular basis.

Papa states his medicine, a controlled substance for pain is $36 for 3 months but he could only get up the amount of $12.46 for some of it. He asked if Papa could help him with getting money for meds. Papa was told to advise his case manager along with calling the number on the back of his insurance card which he had no knowledge of. Papa was reminded to set up any needed vision, hearing or dental visits he needs for the year. Papa stated he doesn't use the OTC benefits as he can't take certain over the counter meds such as ibuprofen or aspirin. Papa does have to take vitamin D 3 as he has prostate cancer. He was told that vitamin should be at a covered discount or possibly free. Papa has no fall risks or medic alert."""

f,medications,Medication review,"""Ms. Barker has been very sad and agitated lately. She is almost to the end of her depression medication prescription and ordered a new refill that was supposed to arrive by January 29th and has not. She has been on the phone for several days trying to have the matter corrected and was told that it should definitely arrive by tomorrow although she is not confident. I advised her that if she was unable to get anywhere with the pharmacies and doctors to let us know and we may be able to help navigate. We spoke at Great length about her family history and genealogy as well as things that she has been through in her life that are behind a lot of her anxiety and behavioral health issues. Severe depression often makes it difficult for her to strive for the things that she would like to have in life such as friends or new experiences but we focused on the good days that she does have and mechanisms that she can put in place to get through the days that are more challenging. We bonded over a shared love of Star Trek and spoke about how revolutionary the show was and how it still deals with issues that are relevant today. She is a lifelong Trekkie. She is currently looking for a new physician that is closer to her home and Westland. The address that is listed on her account in the app is actually the address for her current Doctor Who is in Southfield according to the member. She is an amputee and has a lot of pain management issues. She often finds herself alone and isolated. She has one friend that lives in her apartment building but she snowbirds in Florida and will not be back until April. Her adult children do not come around very often with the exception of her son who brings her her groceries. She has many grandchildren and she is the last living grandparent. We talked about the joy she gets when she remembers her grandchildren being little and special times they had together. She likes to read and watch television in her free time and she also likes to quilt and paint but says she doesn't often have money for supplies. She would like for me to call her again next week and said she had a wonderful time speaking with me today. She was in a much better mood after we spoke and said that she feels she will actually be able to sleep after many nights of insomnia. I encouraged her to reach out as needed to our service and went over the benefits of having an in-person Pal as well."""
