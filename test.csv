She stated her GP does her bloodwork every four months where she goes in has the bloodwork done and then she comes back to the office to review her results. Her doctor has her just on insulin right now while they wait back for the recent lab work to see if they will continue with the metformin or not. The member mentioned she was interested in the glucose reader with sensor in the arm since she does not want to continue pricking her fingers, but wasn't sure if it would be covered by her health plan and if not she could not afford to pay out of pocket. I contacted the HP and spoke with Emily who advised she has coverage for all diabetic supplies at zero cost to her this includes the glucose reader with sensor that she wants to get. Agent Emily advised that the two readers they cover are: Dexcom G6 and Free style Libre. I contacted member to advise of the information I was given by her HP and asked her for her pharmacy phone # so that I could contact them to see which one of the brands they keep in stock. Member provided me with her CVS phone # 772-567-7136 and spoke with Julissa who advised they do not carry the Dexcom but do always carry the Free style Libre. I called the member to advise of the information I was given by her pharmacy so that when she goes to see her doctor next week the script reflects the free style libre brand. She was very grateful for the assistance. "

Spoke with Patty at Dr Petros office (the ophthalmologist the member has been seeing) # 601-268-5144 who advised they do take Humana but do not take the members eye care provider(OON), and this was the reason why she was charged more.
